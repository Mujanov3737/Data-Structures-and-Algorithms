# Data-Structures

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The projects for this course centered around four distinct data structures: vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. The various implementations of these data structures and the analysis of each for their strengths and weaknesses were explored. Ultimately, the course project required a particular data structure to be chosen and implemented given a particular scenario; that scenario being a list of courses that needed to be organized and manipulated to achieve the desired functionality whilst using the chosen data structure.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Analyzing the capabilities of each data structure was the first step in the process of choosing which would be best suited for the project scenario. No data structure is perfect for every scenario thus it is important to understand when and where to use a structure appropriately. For instance, a hash table may provide constant access time but only if there exists a sufficient algorithm to eliminate collisions. A linked-list may provide constant insertion time but requires linear traversal time to find a particular element in the list. After considering all the options of each structure, the appropriate one could be chosen and utilized in the project scenario.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Data structures and algorithms is certainly a difficult computer science subject that requires a significant amount of practice and comfort with logical thinking. Often, learning the conceptual version of the data structure or algorithm was clear and simple for me. Implementing the structures or algorithms using the constructs of the programming language was more difficult. I found that once I had a solid grasp on the concept of a structure, the repetition of implementing the structure in a coding environment was key to solidifying the concept as a whole. Whenever I encountered a roadblock where I was not sure how to proceed, referring back to the readings and looking at examples helped to provide the necessary guidance I needed to push through.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

When I had first started programming, the study of algorithms was a foreign concept to me but I had always wondered if the code I was writing was as efficient as it could be. Was I doing too many iterations? Was there a more efficient way to approach solving this problem that involved less time and less memory? The exposure I have received in this course as to how one can analyze the efficiency of an algorithm to see if it would be best suited for a scenario or if it is likely going to run well will be invaluable to me as my software development studies continue.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Understanding the benefits and pitfalls of various algorithms and data structures is important to utilizing the most appropriate construct for a given program. Simply using a dynamic array for most collections like I had been is a mistake because it does not take into consideration what kind of data is being stored. Additionally, while all searching algorithms have their place depending on the data used, certain searching algorithms seem to be objectively worse than others, which is another consideration I have made in the future when writing programs.
